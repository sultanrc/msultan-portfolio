      Designed with the chaotic precision of a squirrel on espresso in Figma and lovingly duct-taped
      together in Visual Studio Code by yours truly. Fueled by
      <span class="text-green-200">Vue.js</span>, fashionably styled with
      <span class="text-blue-200">Tailwind CSS </span>, and catapulted into the digital void by
      Vercel. Oh, and every single pixel of text? Strutting around in the ever-dapper Comfortaa,
      Inter font.
